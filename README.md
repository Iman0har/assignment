<h2>This project was started with Create-React-App as command.</h2>

  
<p> I have used material ui for design</p>

<p> I used json server for storing the data of the employee</p>
<p>Here the employee data will be filled and after clicking the add button the information will be added to the db.json flile. The data in the server  of the employee or employees will be displayed as shown in the second image</p>

<p>As wee can see the data of the employees we even have the delete button as an option for deleting the employees data. The deleted data will be removed the server and will be disappeared from the page</p>
